     "question": "What are Credit unions?",
     "answer": "Credit unions are member-owned, not-for-profit financial cooperatives that provide savings, loans and other financial services to their members. Credit union membership is based on a common bond, a linkage shared by savers and borrowers who belong to a particular community, organisation, religion or place of employment. Credit unions pool their members’ savings to finance loans rather than rely on outside capital. Members benefit from higher returns on savings, lower rates on loans and no hidden fees."
